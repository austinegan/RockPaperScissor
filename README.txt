Kimberly Zappa: Designed all layout files, integrated layout data into java files, worked with Harris to implement CPU play, 
and created the intents to have app flow smoothly. 

Set backs:
Kim and Austin attempted to build firebase database. Initially we wanted to use the google sign in button. Kim struggled to actually get 
app to function with google sign in. Gradle kept crashing and the version types from examples wouldnt work. We decided to switch to doing
a user/login table instead where users could just pick their own name and store it through firebase. This caused issues when trying to 
insert data. We were connected to the firebase but unable to have our app create a row. Harrison and others helped us research and try to 
find solutions, but time was not on our side after hours wasted getting android studios to function after gradle crashes. 

Ways we could improve:
If we decide to expand on this app we could get firebase working correctly and properly implement the play amongst two different users.
Ways we could improve would be to use google maps and find local players. This would be a better feauture because users could connect to 
those around them. Establishing the leaderboard based on number on wins in the user table and amongst their friends.
